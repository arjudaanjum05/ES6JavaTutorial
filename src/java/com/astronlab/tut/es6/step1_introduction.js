 Introduction:
================
 
 ES6 (aka Ecma Script 2015) introduces Java/Groovy like OOP syntax (Class, Polymorphism, etc) and other keywords. However, it
 actually uses old (ES5) structure(prototype) to acheve OOP achitecture. So before diving into ES6, lets see what is classic "prototype" 
 and how it works.

 Protype:
==========
- Its a template mechanism, like a java "class", from which we create "new" instances.
- Created "objects" mantains a "chain/link" to its "parent", its called "prototype chain".
- Prototype of an object is denoted via: "__poto__"
- child_object.__poto__ === Parent.
